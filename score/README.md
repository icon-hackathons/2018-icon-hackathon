### ICONWithU Score

ICONWithu is consisted of `withu_manager` score managing service user and deploying score and token,

#### How to deploy

First, install `t-bears`  to begin with service.

( If it is not installed, follow the guide at [t-bears](https://github.com/icon-project/t-bears).)

Let's deploy score if you are ready.



##### withu_token

To deploy withu_token, you need name, symbol, amount and decimals parameters.

Input each parameter's data at "deploy.scoreParams" option as follows. 

```json
{
    "uri": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/v3",
    "nid": "0x3",
    "keyStore": null,
    "from": "hxe7af5fcfd8dfc67530a01a0e403882687528dfcb",
    "to": "cx0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "deploy": {
        "stepLimit": "0x87000000",
        "mode": "install",
        "scoreParams": {
            "name":"WithU",
            "symbol":"WTU",
            "amount": "0x2540be400",
            "decimals": "0x12"
        }
    },
    "txresult": {},
    "transfer": {
        "stepLimit": "0xf4240"
    }
}
```

After you write config file as above, execute order as follows.

```sh
tbears deploy withu_token -c token_deploy.json
```

If deploy request succeeds, following message comes up.

```sh
Send deploy request successfully.
If you want to check SCORE deployed successfully, execute txresult command
transaction hash: 0xb1c29df5957137bfbdb5de524e43f6683282bdb984ecda87d0dc1e96088c4ef4
```

You can check the result with following order.

```sh
tbears txresult 0xb1c29df5957137bfbdb5de524e43f6683282bdb984ecda87d0dc1e9088c4ef4
```

You can check request result and scoreAddress deployed.

```json

    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "txHash": "0xb1c29df5957137bfbdb5de524e43f6683282bdb984ecda87d0dc1e96088c4ef4",
